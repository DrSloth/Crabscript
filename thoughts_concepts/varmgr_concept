Apparently hashmaps are very slow.
Local variables can be looked up in a vector (or some other kind of array)
What to do with consts, aspecially pre populated fns is more interesting,
keeping them all in a vec is not that nice.
Pre populated functions could be "inlined" with lazy hash memoization.
Normal consts could be seen just like variables.
The interactive shell would need to parse the things a bit differently then
the global consts then would still be needed inside a map.

NOTE this branch is used to explore optimizations for interpreted files
