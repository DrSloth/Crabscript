#TODO - Modules (should std have to be imported? can it be excluded? maybe like a #no-prelude or a arg switch)
    use 'module' for importing the prelude
    maybe the std prelude is imported automatically if the --no-std flag is given it is not imported
    automatically, maybe config statements started with # that have to be the first lines in a file
    or maybe it is just not imported automatically

#TODO - Remove as much recursion as possible
