Before eliminating some clones
real    0m3.517s
user    0m3.516s
sys     0m0.001s
eliminating some clones did nothing

after eliminating clone and repeated String allocation
real    0m1.838s
user    0m1.838s
sys     0m0.000s

after correcting the previous wrong code and removing String alloc in manager
real    0m1.907s
user    0m1.897s
sys     0m0.009s

Apparently function calls are slow... but why

with while instead of for thus 2 fn calls more
real    0m5.060s
user    0m5.056s
sys     0m0.001s

The problem is found to be the hashing
Ahash was found to be the fastest algo, hash memoization will be done

After Hash memoization for get
real    0m4.024s
user    0m4.022s
sys     0m0.000s

The do function executing 5000000 nop takes only
real    0m0.275s
user    0m0.198s
sys     0m0.078s

The same with a runtime defined no op fn
real    0m1.492s
user    0m1.464s
sys     0m0.028s

Now by eliminating the creation of the new scope and saving it instead
real    0m0.470s
user    0m0.438s
sys     0m0.032s

The for now is only
real    0m1.077s
user    0m1.073s
sys     0m0.004s

hashes are now memoized and a lot of clones of Arc<Variables> are eliminated
still can't get under 1s
